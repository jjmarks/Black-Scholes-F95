# Project Description
A Black-Scholes-Merton pricing engine using Fortran 95.

# Project Aims
The program will take as input a stock price, strike price, time to maturity, underlying volatility and
risk-free interest rate.

The output will provide the solution of the Black-Scholes formula giving the fair price of a
(non-dividend-paying) European call option with the specified inputs. The respective put option price will
also be output, derived through put-call parity.
